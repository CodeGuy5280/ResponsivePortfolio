# Responsive-Portfolio - Hw#2

Portfolio made using bootstrap.

# Description

This portfolio page is meant to display an understanding of the operations of bootstrap.
A link between 3 separate html files all containing links to bootstrap's css and js is used for responsiveness and styling of each individual page.
Each page has it's own purpose as indicated by the labels of the files.
A general index.html serves as the structure of the website as a whole.
The about.html is used to create the layout of the specific "about me" page.
The contact.html is used to create the layout of the specific "contact" page.

# Project Thoughts

The project was a real struggle. I had to look up several guides to bootstrap just to get started.
In the end I believe that my portfolio looks well ok. I don't know if I will ever feel like a project is complete.
If I had more time I would look into embedding a video and getting a sticky nav bar to function properly.
Hopefully my work will show that I can at least figure out how to make a website with bootstrap w/ outside resources I suppose.
